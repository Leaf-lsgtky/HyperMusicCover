/**
 * The theme settings, as a screen of its own.
 *
 * The same choice [LicenseActivity] and [CoverActivity] make, for the same reason: a whole
 * screen arriving is the platform's own transition, it brings its own back handling - gesture,
 * button and the predictive-back animation on Android 13+ - and a page swapped in place inside
 * the settings tab had to imitate all three and matched none of them.
 *
 * The one difference from the screens above: they read their settings once and never change
 * them, while this one is a settings screen whose subject is the theme the screen itself is
 * drawn in. So the settings are held as state here, under [AppTheme], and every change is both
 * saved and recomposed - a change you could only see by going back would be a change made
 * blind.
