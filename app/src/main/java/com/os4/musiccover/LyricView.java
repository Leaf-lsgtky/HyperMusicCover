/**
 * The lock screen's lyrics: one view, drawn by hand, between the collapsed clock and the card.
 *
 * Every animated value belongs to a LINE, never to a slot on screen. The first version kept nine
 * TextViews and handed each its neighbour's text on a line change, so brightness, size and
 * weight stayed with the slot while the words moved - the line arriving at the focus snapped to
 * full brightness and the one leaving snapped dark, and only the far rows animated at all.
 * Here a line carries its own scroll position, emphasis, blur and word fill from the moment it
 * is parsed until the song changes.
 *
 * - Position: every line springs toward the scroll target, but only once its own start delay has
 *   passed - the lines below the focus set off one after another, so the stack flows up rather
 *   than moving as a slab. The spring is also a little softer further from the focus.
 * - Emphasis: one 0..1 per line. Brightness and scale both derive from it. The text is laid out
 *   once - the weight never changes, because a weight change re-wraps the line.
 * - Depth: a line that is not being sung is blurred by its distance from the one that is, drawn
 *   as a blurred bitmap made once per line and distance. A line is sharp while it moves and while it has any
 *   emphasis, and goes out of focus once it has settled - which keeps the motion clean and means
 *   no line ever switches between the blurred and the word-by-word path mid-blur.
 * - Words: a line with word timing is drawn a syllable at a time. Each syllable lifts a little
 *   as it is sung; a long one (a held note) also glows and swells while it lasts. The sung part
 *   is at the line's brightness and the rest at UNSUNG of it, through a soft-edged mask.
 * - Edges: a line fades as it approaches the top or bottom of the band.
 *
 * Frames are only asked for while something moves. Otherwise the view waits for its own
 * pre-draw, which fires whenever anything else in the keyguard window animates, and for
 * LockLyrics' tick, which wakes it at the next line start.
